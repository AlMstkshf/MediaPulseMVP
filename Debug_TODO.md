#### I. Architectural & Core Infrastructure Issues

1.  **Issue:** Inconsistent and Redundant WebSocket Implementations
    *   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:2755), [`server/index.ts`](server/index.ts:609)
    *   **Description:** The application initializes multiple WebSocket server instances using different libraries (`ws` and `socket.io`) and custom managers (`wsManager`, `mainWss`, `io`). This creates a highly complex and redundant real-time communication layer. It leads to duplicated functionality, potential port conflicts, and makes it difficult to ascertain which WebSocket implementation is actively serving client connections. The `socketIoWrapper` attempts to unify broadcasting but is a workaround for a deeper architectural flaw.
    *   **Severity:** Critical
    *   **Recommendation:** Unify the WebSocket implementation to use a single, consistent library (e.g., `socket.io` due to its advanced features like rooms, auto-reconnect, and fallback transports). Remove all redundant `ws` server instances and ensure all real-time communication flows through the chosen unified layer.

2.  **Issue:** Conflicting and Overwritten Port Configuration
    *   **Location:** [`server/index.ts`](server/index.ts:660), [`server/config.ts`](server/config.ts:22)
    *   **Description:** The server's port logic is inconsistent. `server/config.ts` defines `PORT` as `5000` by default, while `server/index.ts` hardcodes `serverPort` to `3000` for production and `4000` for development, then explicitly overwrites `process.env.PORT`. This can lead to confusion, unexpected port assignments, and "address already in use" errors, especially in containerized or managed hosting environments where `PORT` is typically set externally.
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Recommendation:** Centralize port configuration in `server/config.ts`. Ensure `server/index.ts` consistently uses the `PORT` value from `server/config.ts` and respects `process.env.PORT` if it's already set by the environment, rather than overwriting it. Implement clear logging to show the final determined port at startup.

#### II. Security Vulnerabilities & Best Practices

1.  **Issue:** Overly Permissive CORS Configuration
    *   **Location:** [`server/index.ts`](server/index.ts:52), [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:2766)
    *   **Description:** The CORS configuration in `server/index.ts` includes `origin: function(origin, callback) { ... callback(null, origin || true); }` in development, and `*` in `getCorsAllowedOrigins` in `server/config.ts` (which is then used by Socket.IO). While `*` is removed for production in the main CORS middleware, the Socket.IO server explicitly sets `cors: { origin: true, credentials: true }`. This `origin: true` setting for Socket.IO, combined with `credentials: true`, can be a security risk as it effectively allows any origin to make credentialed requests, potentially exposing sensitive data to malicious sites in certain scenarios.
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Recommendation:** For Socket.IO, replace `origin: true` with a specific list of allowed origins, similar to the main Express CORS configuration. Ensure that `credentials: true` is only used when absolutely necessary and only with a tightly controlled `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that does not include `*`.

2.  **Issue:** Inconsistent Cookie Domain Handling
    *   **Location:** [`server/index.ts`](server/index.ts:159)
    *   **Description:** The custom cookie middleware attempts to set `cookieDomain` only for specific hardcoded production hosts (`media-pulse.almstkshf.com`, `rhalftn.replit.app`). For other hosts, the domain is not set, which means the browser will default to the current domain. This can lead to issues in multi-subdomain deployments or if the application is deployed to a new production domain not explicitly listed, potentially causing cookies to not be sent or received correctly across different parts of the application or subdomains.
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Recommendation:** Refine the cookie domain logic to dynamically determine the appropriate domain based on the environment and host, or use a more flexible approach (e.g., setting the domain to the top-level domain for subdomains) if cross-subdomain cookie sharing is intended. Ensure the `isSecure` check is robust for all deployment scenarios.

#### III. Performance Bottlenecks

1.  **Issue:** N+1 Query in Leaderboard Endpoint
    *   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:5941)
    *   **Description:** The `/api/gamification/leaderboard` endpoint fetches leaderboard statistics and then, for each entry, performs a separate database query (`storage.getUser(stats.userId)`) to retrieve user details. This results in an "N+1 query" problem, where N is the number of users on the leaderboard. For a large number of users, this can lead to a significant performance bottleneck due to excessive database calls.
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Recommendation:** Optimize the `getUsersLeaderboard` function in `storage.ts` to fetch user details along with the leaderboard stats in a single, more efficient query (e.g., using a SQL JOIN or a single batch query for all user IDs).

2.  **Issue:** Overly Complex and Potentially Inefficient Buffered Updates
    *   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:3111)
    *   **Description:** The buffered updates system, designed to reduce WebSocket traffic, uses a complex `getNextScheduledTimeForType` function and `setTimeout` calls to stagger updates. While the intention is good, this manual scheduling can be prone to timing drift, race conditions, and might not be the most efficient way to manage buffered broadcasts, especially if the server load fluctuates. The hardcoded 15-minute intervals might also not be optimal for all types of updates.
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Recommendation:** Simplify the buffering and scheduling logic. Consider using a more robust queueing mechanism or a simpler `setInterval` for each update type if the staggering is critical. Re-evaluate if the 15-minute interval is appropriate for all data types or if some require more real-time updates.

#### IV. Code Quality & Maintainability

1.  **Issue:** Redundant Health Check Endpoints
    *   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:137), [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:1778)
    *   **Description:** The application defines two distinct `/api/health` endpoints. While one is more detailed (testing database connection), having two identical paths can lead to confusion, make API documentation unclear, and potentially cause unexpected behavior depending on middleware order.
    *   **Severity:** Low
    *   **Recommendation:** Consolidate the health check logic into a single, comprehensive endpoint. If different levels of detail are required, use query parameters (e.g., `/api/health?full=true`) or separate, clearly named endpoints (e.g., `/api/health/db`, `/api/health/nlp`).

2.  **Issue:** Inconsistent Input Validation Approaches
    *   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:467) (e.g., `/api/media/entities`), compared to other routes using Zod.
    *   **Description:** While many API endpoints correctly utilize Zod for robust schema validation, some endpoints (e.g., `/api/media/entities` POST) still rely on manual `if (!data.field)` checks. This inconsistency can lead to less comprehensive validation, potential missed edge cases, and makes the codebase harder to maintain and reason about.
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Recommendation:** Standardize input validation across all API endpoints using Zod schemas. This ensures consistent, declarative, and robust validation logic.

3.  **Issue:** Use of Global Variables for WebSocket Broadcasts
    *   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:1136), [`server/routes.ts`](server/routes.ts:3240)
    *   **Description:** The application uses `(global as any).broadcastSocialUpdate`, `(global as any).broadcastKeywordAlert`, etc., to make WebSocket broadcast functions globally accessible. This is generally considered a bad practice in TypeScript/Node.js as it bypasses type safety, creates implicit dependencies, and makes code harder to test and refactor.
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Recommendation:** Refactor the broadcast functions to be explicitly imported or passed as dependencies to the services/routes that need them. Consider using a dedicated event emitter or a dependency injection pattern to manage these cross-cutting concerns.
## 1. Exposed Secrets & Environment Leaks

### Finding: Hardcoded Session Secret Fallback
*   **Location:** [`server/auth.ts:36`](server/auth.ts:36)
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Description:** The application uses a hardcoded fallback session secret (`ajman_police_media_secret`) if `process.env.SESSION_SECRET` is not set. This makes the application vulnerable to session hijacking and other related attacks in environments where the `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable is not properly configured.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove the hardcoded fallback secret. The application should fail to start if `SESSION_SECRET` is not provided in production environments. For development, a default can be used, but it should be clearly documented as such and not used in production.

### Finding: Default Admin Credentials in In-Memory Storage
*   **Location:** [`server/storage.ts:355`](server/storage.ts:355)
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Description:** The `MemStorage` class initializes an admin user with a default, unhashed password "admin123". This is a severe security risk, as it provides a known backdoor into the system if the in-memory storage is used or if this code is ever mistakenly run in a production database seeding process.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove the default admin user creation in `MemStorage` for production builds. Ensure that any initial admin user creation in a production environment uses securely hashed passwords and requires manual setup or strong, randomly generated credentials. Implement a mechanism to force password changes for default or first-time logins.

### Finding: Placeholder Session Secret in `deployment.env`
*   **Location:** [`deployment.env:25`](deployment.env:25)
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Description:** The `deployment.env` file contains a placeholder `SESSION_SECRET=your-production-session-secret`. If this file is used directly in a production environment without modification, it exposes a weak and easily guessable secret, making the application vulnerable to session hijacking.
*   **Recommendation:** Instruct users to replace `your-production-session-secret` with a strong, unique, and randomly generated secret before deploying to production. Consider using a tool or script to generate this secret during deployment.

### Finding: Logging Sensitive Information in Debug Route
*   **Location:** [`server/auth.ts:95`](server/auth.ts:95)
*   **Severity:** Low (can become Medium if exposed in production)
*   **Description:** The `/api/auth/debug` route exposes sensitive session and cookie information, including `sessionID` and `req.cookies`. While intended for debug, if this endpoint is accessible in production, it could leak sensitive information.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure the `/api/auth/debug` route is strictly disabled or protected in production environments. This can be done by conditionally enabling it based on `NODE_ENV` or by implementing strong authentication/authorization checks for this route.

## 2. Poor Modular Boundaries & Monoliths

### Finding: Large File Size and Monolithic Data Access Layer
*   **Location:** [`server/storage.ts`](server/storage.ts) (3641 lines)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The `server/storage.ts` file is excessively large (3641 lines) and acts as a monolithic data access layer, handling all CRUD operations for numerous entities for both in-memory and database storage. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, makes the file difficult to read, maintain, and test, and increases the risk of introducing bugs. It also indicates poor modular boundaries.
*   **Recommendation:** Refactor `server/storage.ts` into smaller, more focused modules. Each entity (e.g., `UserStorage`, `MediaItemStorage`, `SocialPostStorage`) should have its own dedicated file or module responsible for its data operations. Consider abstracting the storage interface further to separate the in-memory and database implementations more cleanly.

## 3. Security Vulnerabilities

### Finding: Overly Permissive CORS Policy (Wildcard)
*   **Location:** [`server/config.ts:80`](server/config.ts:80)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The `getCorsAllowedOrigins` function in `server/config.ts` includes `*` as an allowed origin, which is overly permissive and can lead to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove the `*` wildcard from the CORS allowed origins. Explicitly list all allowed origins, including all necessary Replit domains and any custom production domains. If dynamic origins are needed, ensure they are validated against a strict whitelist or a more secure pattern.

### Finding: Insecure CORS Policy in Security Middleware
*   **Location:** [`server/middleware/security.ts:41`](server/middleware/security.ts:41)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The CORS policy in `server/middleware/security.ts` allows `origin || '*'` in development. While the production check is better, the `origin || '*'` in development is still too broad and could lead to issues if not properly contained. Additionally, relying solely on `endsWith('.mediapulse.com')` for production allows all subdomains, which might not be intended.
*   **Recommendation:** For development, use a more specific origin like `http://localhost:PORT` or a list of known development origins instead of `*`. For production, explicitly list all allowed domains rather than relying solely on `endsWith`. If subdomains are truly needed, ensure they are managed securely.

### Finding: Weakened Content Security Policy (CSP)
*   **Location:** [`server/middleware/security.ts:22`](server/middleware/security.ts:22) and [`server/middleware/security.ts:23`](server/middleware/security.ts:23)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The Content Security Policy (CSP) in `server/middleware/security.ts` includes `'unsafe-inline'` for `scriptSrc` and `styleSrc`, and `'unsafe-eval'` for `scriptSrc`. These directives significantly weaken the CSP and make the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` from the CSP. For inline scripts and styles, use nonces or hashes. For dynamic script evaluation, consider refactoring the code to avoid `eval` or use a more secure approach.

### Finding: Non-functional CSRF Protection
*   **Location:** [`server/middleware/security.ts:101`](server/middleware/security.ts:101)
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Description:** The application attempts to validate a `csrf-token` from `req.cookies` but there is no apparent code that generates and sets this `csrf-token` cookie. This means the CSRF protection is effectively non-functional, making the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks for all non-GET requests that are not explicitly bypassed.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a robust CSRF token generation and setting mechanism. This typically involves:
    1.  Generating a unique CSRF token on the server for each session.
    2.  Setting this token as an HttpOnly cookie (to prevent client-side access) and also making it available to the client (e.g., via a meta tag or a dedicated API endpoint).
    3.  The client then sends this token in a custom header (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`) with every non-GET request.
    4.  The server compares the token from the header with the token from the HttpOnly cookie.

### Finding: CSRF Protection Bypass for API Tokens and Auth Paths
*   **Location:** [`server/middleware/security.ts:104`](server/middleware/security.ts:104) and [`server/middleware/security.ts:107`](server/middleware/security.ts:107)
*   **Severity:** Low (can become Medium if not handled carefully)
*   **Description:** The CSRF protection is skipped in development mode and for API token requests (`/api/auth/` paths or `Bearer` token in Authorization header). While skipping in development is common, the API token bypass might be acceptable depending on the API's design, but it should be explicitly understood that these endpoints are not CSRF protected. The `/api/auth/` path bypass is concerning if it includes sensitive operations beyond initial authentication.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure that the `/api/auth/` paths that bypass CSRF are only for authentication (login, register) and do not perform state-changing operations that could be exploited via CSRF. For API token authentication, it's generally acceptable to bypass CSRF as tokens are typically sent in headers and not vulnerable to CSRF in the same way as cookie-based sessions. Document this design choice clearly.

### Finding: Incomplete Error Handling for Login History
*   **Location:** [`server/auth.ts:206`](server/auth.ts:206)
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** If an error occurs while recording login history in `server/auth.ts`, the error is logged to the console (`console.error`), but the login process still proceeds. While this prevents a login failure due to a logging issue, it means that login history might be incomplete or inaccurate without proper alerting.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a more robust error handling mechanism for critical background tasks like login history recording. This could involve: sending alerts to monitoring systems, retrying the operation, or using a dedicated logging service that guarantees delivery.

### Finding: Potential for SQL Injection (Mitigated by ORM, but review needed)
*   **Location:** `server/storage.ts` (specifically the `DatabaseStorage` class methods using `sql` template literal)
*   **Severity:** Low (due to Drizzle ORM, but good to note)
*   **Description:** While Drizzle ORM is used, which generally prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries, it's important to ensure that all queries are constructed using Drizzle's safe methods and that no raw SQL interpolation is used with untrusted input. The `sql` template literal is used in several places.
*   **Recommendation:** Conduct a thorough review of all Drizzle ORM queries, especially those using the `sql` template literal, to ensure that all user-provided input is properly parameterized and never directly interpolated into raw SQL strings.

*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:2755`](server/routes.ts:2755), [`server/routes.ts:2867`](server/routes.ts:2867)
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Description:** The application initializes multiple WebSocket server instances using different libraries (`ws` and `socket.io`) and custom managers (`wsManager`, `mainWss`, `io`).

## 4. Performance Bottlenecks

### Finding: N+1 Query in Leaderboard Endpoint
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:5941`](server/routes.ts:5941)
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Description:** The `/api/gamification/leaderboard` endpoint fetches leaderboard statistics and then, for each entry, performs a separate database query (`storage.getUser(stats.userId)`) to retrieve user details. This results in an "N+1 query" problem, where N is the number of users on the leaderboard. For a large number of users, this can lead to a significant performance bottleneck due to excessive database calls.
*   **Recommendation:** Optimize the `getUsersLeaderboard` function in `storage.ts` to fetch user details along with the leaderboard stats in a single, more efficient query (e.g., using a SQL JOIN or a single batch query for all user IDs).

### Finding: Overly Complex and Potentially Inefficient Buffered Updates
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:3111`](server/routes.ts:3111)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The buffered updates system, designed to reduce WebSocket traffic, uses a complex `getNextScheduledTimeForType` function and `setTimeout` calls to stagger updates.

### Finding: Synchronous File System Operations in Multer Storage
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:89`](server/routes.ts:89) (`fs.existsSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The `avatarStorage` configuration for Multer uses synchronous file system operations (`fs.existsSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`). While these might be acceptable during application startup, if the `destination` function is called frequently during runtime (e.g., for every file upload), these synchronous calls can block the Node.js event loop, leading to performance bottlenecks, especially under heavy load.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure that the `uploads/avatars` directory is created asynchronously during application initialization, or use asynchronous `fs.promises` methods if the directory creation needs to happen dynamically during runtime. For Multer, it's generally better to ensure the destination directory exists before starting the server.

## 5. Code Quality & Maintainability

### Finding: Redundant Health Check Endpoints
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:137`](server/routes.ts:137), [`server/routes.ts:1778`](server/routes.ts:1778)
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** The application defines two distinct `/api/health` endpoints. While one is more detailed (testing database connection), having two identical paths can lead to confusion, make API documentation unclear, and potentially cause unexpected behavior depending on middleware order.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate the health check logic into a single, comprehensive endpoint. If different levels of detail are required, use query parameters (e.g., `/api/health?full=true`) or separate, clearly named endpoints (e.g., `/api/health/db`, `/api/health/nlp`).

### Finding: Inconsistent Input Validation Approaches
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:467`](server/routes.ts:467) (e.g., `/api/media/entities`), compared to other routes using Zod.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** While many API endpoints correctly utilize Zod for robust schema validation, some endpoints (e.g., `/api/media/entities` POST) still rely on manual `if (!data.field)` checks. This inconsistency can lead to less comprehensive validation, potential missed edge cases, and makes the codebase harder to maintain and reason about.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize input validation across all API endpoints using Zod schemas. This ensures consistent, declarative, and robust validation logic.

### Finding: Use of Global Variables for WebSocket Broadcasts
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:1136`](server/routes.ts:1136), [`server/routes.ts:3240`](server/routes.ts:3240)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The application uses `(global as any).broadcastSocialUpdate`, `(global as any).broadcastKeywordAlert`, etc., to make WebSocket broadcast functions globally accessible. This is generally considered a bad practice in TypeScript/Node.js as it bypasses type safety, creates implicit dependencies, and makes code harder to test and refactor.
*   **Recommendation:** Refactor the broadcast functions to be explicitly imported or passed as dependencies to the services/routes that need them. Consider using a dedicated event emitter or a dependency injection pattern to manage these cross-cutting concerns.

### Finding: Duplicated Logic for NLP Service Imports and Fallbacks
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:1903`](server/routes.ts:1903) (and similar blocks for `analyzeSentiment`, `extractEntities`)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The `processText`, `analyzeSentiment`, and `extractEntities` functions (and their corresponding endpoints) contain significant duplication in their logic for dynamically importing Rasa/AraBERT services and implementing fallback mechanisms. This leads to code repetition and makes it harder to maintain and update the NLP service integration.
*   **Recommendation:** Centralize the NLP service import and fallback logic into a single helper function or a dedicated NLP service orchestrator. This function would handle the dynamic imports and the conditional calling of Rasa/AraBERT or fallback services, returning a unified result. The route handlers would then simply call this centralized function.

### Finding: Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Values
*   **Location:** Throughout `server/routes.ts` (e.g., `5 * 1024 * 1024` for file size, `15 * 60 * 1000` for rate limiting, `1-5` to `0-100` sentiment conversion, `91%` resolution rate assumption).
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** Many numerical values and strings are hardcoded directly into the code without clear explanations or constants. This makes the code less readable, harder to modify, and prone to errors if the meaning of these "magic numbers" is not immediately obvious.
*   **Recommendation:** Replace magic numbers with named constants (e.g., `MAX_AVATAR_SIZE_MB`, `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `SENTIMENT_SCALE_MAX`). Define these constants in a central configuration file or at the top of the relevant module.

### Finding: Inconsistent Date Handling
*   **Location:** Throughout `server/routes.ts` (e.g., `new Date().toISOString()`, `new Date(Date.now() - ...)` vs. `new Date(dateFrom as string)`).
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** Dates are handled inconsistently, sometimes using `new Date().toISOString()`, sometimes `new Date(Date.now() - ...)`, and sometimes parsing strings directly. While functional, this can lead to subtle bugs related to timezones or date parsing if not handled carefully.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize date handling using a consistent approach, preferably leveraging a dedicated date utility library (like `date-fns` or `moment.js` if not already in use) for parsing, formatting, and calculations to ensure robustness and avoid common pitfalls.

### Finding: Direct Mock Data in API Endpoints
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:502`](server/routes.ts:502) (`/api/media/entities` GET), [`server/routes.ts:4751`](server/routes.ts:4751) (`/api/social/accounts` GET), [`server/routes.ts:4607`](server/routes.ts:4607) (`/api/kpis` GET), [`server/routes.ts:5703`](server/routes.ts:5703) (`/api/reports/templates` GET)
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** Several API endpoints return hardcoded mock data instead of fetching from the `storage` layer (which would typically interact with a database). This indicates incomplete implementation or a reliance on in-memory data that might not persist or scale. While useful for initial development, it's a significant issue for a production-ready application.
*   **Recommendation:** Replace all mock data responses with calls to the `storage` layer to fetch actual data from the database. Ensure that the database schema and `storage` methods support the data structures required by these endpoints.

### Finding: Unused Imports/Variables
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:30`](server/routes.ts:30) (`// Removed perplexity service import`), [`server/routes.ts:47`](server/routes.ts:47) (`// AI assistant imports removed`), [`server/routes.ts:1537`](server/routes.ts:1537) (`// AI assistant contextual tips and Q&A routes removed`), [`server/routes.ts:1573`](server/routes.ts:1573) (`// AI Assistant routes removed`), [`server/routes.ts:4015`](server/routes.ts:4015) (`// AI Assistant routes removed`), [`server/routes.ts:4017`](server/routes.ts:4017) (`// Domain-specific AI assistant function calls removed`), [`server/routes.ts:4019`](server/routes.ts:4019) (`// Domain-specific AI Assistant endpoints removed`), [`server/routes.ts:4021`](server/routes.ts:4021) (`// Function router endpoint for domain-specific assistant removed`)
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** There are commented-out imports and sections explicitly marked as "removed" for AI assistant functionality. While these might be remnants of previous development, they clutter the codebase and can be confusing.
*   **Recommendation:** Clean up the codebase by removing all commented-out or unused imports and code blocks. If the functionality is truly removed, delete the code. If it's temporarily disabled, use feature flags or separate branches.

### Finding: Inconsistent Error Response Structure
*   **Location:** Throughout `server/routes.ts` (e.g., `res.status(400).json({ message: "..." })`, `res.status(500).json({ message: "...", error: (error as Error).message })`, `res.status(500).json({ error: "...", details: "..." })`).
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** The error responses from different API endpoints have inconsistent structures. Some return `message`, others `error`, and some include `details`. This makes it harder for frontend clients to consistently parse and display error messages.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize the error response format across all API endpoints. A common practice is to use a consistent JSON structure, e.g., `{ status: 'error', code: 'ERROR_CODE', message: 'Human-readable message', details: 'Optional technical details' }`.

### Finding: Direct `console.log`/`console.error` for Logging
*   **Location:** Throughout `server/routes.ts`
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** The application uses direct `console.log` and `console.error` for logging. While simple, this approach lacks features like log levels, structured logging, log rotation, and integration with centralized logging systems, making it difficult to manage logs in a production environment.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a dedicated logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) with configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error) and structured logging capabilities. This allows for better control over log output and easier integration with monitoring tools.

### Finding: Unnecessary Type Assertions (`as any`) and `(global as any)`
*   **Location:** [`server/routes.ts:1136`](server/routes.ts:1136), [`server/routes.ts:3240`](server/routes.ts:3240) and others.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The use of `as any` and `(global as any)` bypasses TypeScript's type checking, which can hide potential bugs and make the code harder to refactor safely. While sometimes necessary for integrating with third-party libraries that lack proper type definitions, excessive use indicates a lack of type safety.
*   **Recommendation:** Minimize the use of `as any`. For global variables, consider refactoring to use dependency injection or explicit imports. If type assertions are unavoidable, add comments explaining why they are necessary.

### Finding: Inconsistent Use of `parseInt` vs. `Number` for ID Parsing
*   **Location:** Throughout `server/routes.ts` (e.g., `parseInt(req.params.id)` vs. `Number(sentiment)`).
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** Both `parseInt` and `Number` are used to convert string parameters to numbers. While both can work, `parseInt` is generally preferred for integer IDs as it stops parsing at the first non-digit character, whereas `Number` will return `NaN` for non-numeric strings. Inconsistent usage can lead to subtle differences in behavior.
*   **Recommendation:** Standardize on `parseInt` for integer IDs and `parseFloat` or `Number` for floating-point numbers, ensuring consistent error handling for `NaN` results. Zod validation can also handle this robustly.
