# Media Pulse - Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the comprehensive requirements for the Media Pulse platform, a robust media monitoring and analytics solution. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear understanding of the system's architecture, core functionalities, data flows, and underlying business logic, serving as a foundational guide for development, testing, and deployment.

Media Pulse aims to empower users with real-time insights into social media trends, traditional media coverage, and sentiment analysis, facilitating informed decision-making and effective communication strategies.

## 2. Overall Architecture (High-Level)

The Media Pulse platform is built on a modern layered architecture, designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

-   **Client Layer**: A React.js application with TypeScript, providing the user interface. It utilizes React Query for state management, ShadCN/UI for components, and i18next for internationalization. It connects to the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time updates.
-   **Backend API Layer**: An Express.js application handling API requests, business logic, and communication with external services. It uses Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL interaction, Passport.js for authentication, and a WebSocket server for real-time communication.
-   **External Services Layer**: Integrates with various third-party services for advanced functionalities, including:
    *   Rasa NLU/Core for conversational AI.
    *   OpenAI/Claude for content generation and analysis.
    *   AWS Comprehend and Google Cloud Natural Language for NLP tasks (entity extraction, sentiment analysis).
    *   News APIs for media content ingestion.
    *   Email services for notifications.
-   **Data Storage Layer**: Primarily uses PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, including user data, media data, social data, and analytics results.

**Key Architectural Patterns**: Microservices, Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Event-Driven Architecture, Internationalization.
