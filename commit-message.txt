fix: Deployment configuration for Replit

This commit addresses deployment issues by:

- Enhancing the fix-build.js script with better error handling
- Creating proper build directory structure (build/client and build/server)
- Adding symlinks for static file serving
- Creating deploy.sh for simplifying the deployment process
- Adding detailed deployment documentation

These changes ensure the application can be properly deployed on Replit.

Testing:
- Verified build directory structure is created correctly
- Confirmed server can run from build directory
- Tested client file access via symlinks
