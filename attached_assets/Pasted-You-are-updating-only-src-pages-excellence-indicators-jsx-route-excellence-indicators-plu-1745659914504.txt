You are updating **only** `src/pages/excellence-indicators.jsx` (route `/excellence-indicators`) plus the two locale files. Do **not** create new pages or extra components.

## 1. Fix Government Communication
- Currently shows “No data…”.  
- Under its accordion, render **all six** sub-indicators (Arabic & English labels via `t(…)`), with real values from `kpiService`:
  1. Coverage Volume  
  2. Positive Coverage Rate  
  3. Media Sentiment Index  
  4. Social Media Engagement Rate  
  5. Response Time to Media Inquiries  
  6. Share of Voice in Media  
- Remove any placeholder or empty table.

## 2. Correct Innovation sub-indicators
- Now you see three Arabic metrics + six English rows with “Data not available.”  
- Replace placeholders:
  - Map the three Arabic rows to the first three sub-indicators (Implemented Innovations, Idea Rate, Employee Participation) and bind them to real data keys.
  - For the remaining three (Innovation Awards Count, Operational Efficiency Improvement, Innovation Media Coverage), call the correct endpoints or service methods so they display actual values rather than “Data not available.”

## 3. Overhaul Smart Empowerment (“Smart Transformation”)
- Remove the three unrelated Arabic rows (`معدل النقر`, `معدل التحويل`, `مدة المشاهدة`).
- Under its accordion, render exactly these five sub-indicators with live data:
  1. Digital Services %  
  2. Digital Services Adoption Rate  
  3. Smart Services User Satisfaction  
  4. Internal Processes Automation %  
  5. No. of Smart Initiatives Implemented  

## 4. Build Data & Knowledge section
- Rename “Data Management” header to **“Data & Knowledge”**.
- Under its accordion, fetch and display these five sub-indicators:
  1. Knowledge Sharing Sessions Count  
  2. Avg. Training Hours per Employee  
  3. Core Data Accuracy Rate  
  4. Statistical Reports Published  
  5. Data-Driven Decision Index  

## 5. Data binding
- Ensure each sub-indicator uses the correct `kpiService.getXxx()` or API call.
- Do not leave any “Data not available”: if the API returns `null` or `undefined`, display `0` (or “0 %” for percentages).

## 6. Inputs & Controls
- Keep the date‐range picker and axis dropdown at top. They must re-fetch **all** values on change.

## 7. UI & i18n
- Continue using Tailwind (`#f9f4e9`, `#cba344`, `p-4`, `rounded-2xl`), shared components (`<KpiTable>`, `<Accordion>`, etc.).
- Wrap **every** label in `t('excellence.<key>')`.
- Update only `/locales/en/excellence.json` and `/locales/ar/excellence.json` with the new keys for the six Communication metrics, six Innovation metrics, five Smart metrics, and five Data & Knowledge metrics.

## 8. Testing
- In `__tests__/excellence-indicators.test.jsx`, add assertions to verify:
  - The Communication accordion lists exactly six items with correct values.  
  - Innovation lists exactly six sub-indicators with non-empty values.  
  - Smart lists exactly five sub-indicators (no placeholders).  
  - Data & Knowledge lists exactly five sub-indicators.

**Output:** a unified diff patch for:
- `src/pages/excellence-indicators.jsx`
- `/locales/en/excellence.json`
- `/locales/ar/excellence.json`
