As an AI coding agent, your task is to create and execute a comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) strategy for the entire developed website. The steps should include:

Test Plan Development:

Design a detailed and structured QA test plan covering all aspects of the websiteâ€™s functionality.

Prioritize testing based on critical features, user impact, and performance requirements.

Testing Areas:

Functionality Testing: Ensure every feature and functionality performs as expected without errors. This includes testing all forms, buttons, links, and workflows.

Asset Verification: Confirm that all visual and media assets (images, videos, icons, etc.) are correctly placed and render properly across all devices and browsers.

Database Integration: Verify that the database connections are stable, queries return accurate results, and data is correctly stored and retrieved.

Backend & Frontend Integration: Test the seamless interaction between the backend (APIs, data flow) and frontend (UI/UX, rendering) components, ensuring smooth user experience.

Usability and User Experience: Assess the overall usability of the website, ensuring intuitive navigation, accessibility, and performance on multiple devices.

Error Identification:

Identify and document all issues, errors, or discrepancies encountered during testing.

Categorize them based on severity (critical, major, minor) to prioritize fixes.

Development Enhancement Insights:

Highlight areas for potential improvement, both from a functionality and performance perspective. This may include optimization opportunities, security enhancements, or better code practices.

Action Plan for Resolution:

Create a detailed, step-by-step action plan to address each identified issue, including exact coding fixes, design adjustments, or integrations.

Clearly outline the development steps and expected timeline for each fix.

Present this plan to the team for review and approval before proceeding with the implementation of fixes.

Once the action plan is approved, execute the necessary corrections and optimizations, ensuring that the website meets all defined quality standards and functions flawlessly.
