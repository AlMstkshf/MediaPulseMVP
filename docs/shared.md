# Shared Components Documentation

The `shared/` directory contains code that is designed to be used by both the client-side (`client/`) and server-side (`server/`) applications. The primary purpose of this separation is to ensure consistency in data structures and types across the full stack, reducing the likelihood of mismatches and errors.

## 1. Project Structure

*   **`shared/schema.ts`**: This is the main file within the `shared/` directory. It defines common data schemas, interfaces, and types that are utilized by both the frontend and backend.

## 2. Core Component: `shared/schema.ts`

The `shared/schema.ts` file is critical for maintaining data consistency and type safety throughout the MediaPulse MVP.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Data Model Definition**: Defines the structure of data objects that are exchanged between the client and server (e.g., user objects, message formats, report structures).
*   **Type Safety**: Provides TypeScript interfaces and types that can be imported and used by both frontend components (e.g., for API response parsing, state management) and backend services (e.g., for request body validation, database interaction).
*   **Single Source of Truth**: By centralizing schema definitions, it acts as a single source of truth for data shapes, ensuring that changes to the data model are reflected consistently across the entire application.

**Example Use Cases:**
*   Defining the structure of a `ChatMessage` object that is sent from the client to the server and then processed by the bot.
*   Specifying the interface for a `NewsArticle` that is fetched from an external API by the server and then displayed on the client.
*   Declaring enums or literal types that are used in both frontend forms and backend validation logic.

## 3. Benefits of Shared Components

*   **Consistency**: Ensures that both the client and server are working with the same understanding of data structures, preventing common integration bugs.
*   **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript to provide compile-time checks, catching potential data-related errors early in the development cycle.
*   **Reduced Duplication**: Avoids the need to define the same data structures twice (once for the frontend and once for the backend), leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
*   **Improved Collaboration**: Facilitates smoother collaboration between frontend and backend developers by providing a clear contract for data exchange.
