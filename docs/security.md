## Security Overview

The Media Pulse platform follows security best practices to protect user data and system integrity. Key security measures include:

- Secure authentication with password hashing using bcrypt
- Role-based access control
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- Multi-factor authentication support for sensitive accounts
- Session management with secure cookie settings
- Failed login attempt limiting to prevent brute-force attacks

### Authorization

- Role-based access control with the following roles:
  - `admin`: Full system access
  - `editor`: Content management and reporting access
  - `analyst`: Read-only access to analytics and reporting
  - `user`: Basic access to assigned functionality
- Permission checks at both API and UI levels
- Principle of least privilege applied throughout the system

## API Security

API security is implemented in `server/middleware/security.ts`.

### Security Headers

The platform uses Helmet to set security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

### CORS Configuration

- Restrictive CORS policy that only allows specific origins
- Limited HTTP methods and headers
- Credentials support for authenticated requests

### Rate Limiting

- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Progressive delays for excessive requests
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting

### Request Validation

- Strict input validation using Zod schemas
- Content type restrictions
- Request size limitations

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Environment variable encryption for secrets

### Sensitive Data Handling

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) minimization
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Secure deletion practices

### Database Security

- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Limited database user permissions
- Database connection pooling with timeout protection

## Frontend Security

### React Security

- React Context for secure state management
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- CSP (Content Security Policy) to restrict resource loading

### Form Security

- Client-side validation
- CSRF token inclusion in forms
- File upload validation and sanitization

### Authentication UI

- Secure user authentication flows
- Password strength indicators
- Account lockout notifications

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency auditing with `npm audit`
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- SCA (Software Composition Analysis) for third-party code

### Security Updates

- Patching process for security vulnerabilities
- Scheduled dependency updates
- Version pinning for critical dependencies

## Security Testing

### Static Analysis

- ESLint security plugins
- TypeScript for type safety
- Automatic code scanning in CI/CD

### Dynamic Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Scheduled security assessments

### Manual Reviews

- Security code reviews for critical components
- Authentication flow testing
- Permission boundary testing

## Incident Response

### Detection

- Security logging and monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual activity
- User report mechanisms

### Response Process

1. Identification of security incidents
2. Containment to limit impact
3. Eradication of threats
4. Recovery of systems
5. Post-incident analysis and improvement

### Reporting

- Security incident notification procedures
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Compliance reporting requirements

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables control security features:

```
# Authentication
SESSION_SECRET=<random-secret>
COOKIE_SECRET=<random-secret>
PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRY=86400
MFA_TOKEN_EXPIRY=300

# API Security
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://mediapulse.com,https://admin.mediapulse.com

# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<encryption-key>
```

### Security Middleware

Security middleware is applied in the following order:

1. Helmet (security headers)
2. CORS configuration
3. Rate limiting
4. Request size limiting
5. XSS protection
6. Authentication
7. Authorization

## Best Practices for Developers

1. Always use parameterized queries for database operations
2. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
3. Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
4. Follow the principle of least privilege when designing new features
5. Use the security middleware for all new routes
6. Regularly review logs for security anomalies
