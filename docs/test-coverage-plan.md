# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

This document outlines our strategy to achieve â‰¥80% test coverage across the Media Pulse platform.

## Current Test Coverage

Current test coverage needs to be assessed using Jest's coverage reporting:

```bash
./run-tests.sh coverage
```

## Coverage Targets by Component

| Component Type | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Core Services  | TBD             | 90%             | High     |
| API Routes     | TBD             | 85%             | High     |
| UI Components  | TBD             | 80%             | Medium   |
| Hooks & Utils  | TBD             | 85%             | Medium   |
| Integration    | TBD             | 70%             | High     |

## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Backend Service Tests

Focus on core functionality:
- NLP service (sentiment analysis, entity extraction)
- Storage service (CRUD operations)
- Authentication service
- WebSocket service

**Priority tests:**
- Sentiment analysis with different languages
- Error handling in storage operations
- Authentication flow and permission checks
- Real-time notification delivery

### 2. API Route Tests

Test all API endpoints with various scenarios:
- Valid inputs
- Invalid inputs
- Edge cases
- Authentication and authorization

**Priority routes:**
- `/api/nlp/*` endpoints
- `/api/social-posts/*` endpoints
- `/api/chat/*` endpoints
- Authentication endpoints

### 3. React Component Tests

Focus on critical UI components:
- ChatWidget
- Dashboard components
- Data visualization components
- Form components

**Priority components:**
- ChatWidget (complete conversation flow)
- Dashboard layout and widgets
- Search components
- Alert components

### 4. Hook Tests

Test custom React hooks:
- useWebSocket
- useAuthentication
- useSentimentAnalysis
- useTranslation

### 5. Integration Tests

Focus on complete user flows:
- Chat conversation flows
- Dashboard data loading and updating
- Search and filter operations
- Authentication and session management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Path Testing (Week 1)

- Identify and test the most critical user paths
- Focus on core functionality that affects user experience
- Establish baseline coverage metrics

### Phase 2: Service and API Coverage (Week 2)

- Implement comprehensive tests for backend services
- Test all API endpoints with various inputs
- Focus on error handling and edge cases

### Phase 3: UI Component Testing (Week 3)

- Test all major UI components
- Focus on interactivity and user feedback
- Test responsive design functionality

### Phase 4: Integration and E2E (Week 4)

- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Test cross-component interactions
- Validate complete user workflows

## Coverage Monitoring

- Run coverage reports after each phase
- Identify components below target coverage
- Prioritize additional tests for low-coverage areas

## Continuous Improvement

- Add tests for every new feature
- Update tests when existing functionality changes
- Run coverage reports weekly to ensure maintenance of coverage targets

## Resources Required

- Jest and React Testing Library for component tests
- Supertest for API testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
